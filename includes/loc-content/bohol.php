Bohol, a beautiful island that is said to be the most visited tourist destination in the Philippines. The province offers more than just out of this world wonders, powdery white sand beaches, incommensurable marine life, and top of the line resorts.<br/>
When you reach Bohol, the first stop is Alona Beach in Panglao Island located in the southwest part of the province where a kilometer of perfectly white sand heaven awaits you, considered as one of the most famous beaches with a wide array of resorts to meet every tourist's expectation and budget. Snorkeling and Diving are offered in Alona Beach for water buffs and licensed PADI holders that offer a lot of packages where you can explore the rich marine life of Bohol. For a more extreme experience, head on to Hinagdanan Cave 15 minutes away from Alona Beach, a large cave chamber with an underground lake where swimming is permitted. The cave is very private, once inside all you will hear are echoes bouncing from its walls. A word of warning, the pool in the cave is rather deep and the water is chilly, making you feel like you are in another dimension. Before you head on deep into the town of Bohol, consider having a side trip in Tagbilaran City where the site of the Blood Shrine is situated. This happened on March 16, 1565 by Miguel Loped de Legaspi and Sikatuna as a symbol of peace and friendship. You can schedule a meet and greet with an equally well-known critter in Bohol in all its cuteness, the Tarsier. The Philippine Tarsier Sanctuary is in Corella Town in Bohol an institution that advocates to the protection and conduct scientific research on the endangered tarsiers. Visit Iglesia Parroquial de San Pedro Apostol or popularly known as the Loboc Church is one of the oldest church in the province, established during the 1600's by Jesuits that established a Christian community in Baclayon. The church is ranked as a National Historical Landmark for its coral stone structure and antique interiors. Work your way to the Loboc River where visitors are offered a cruise in the most beautiful and serene section of the river where you can eat lunch buffet style in their floating restaurant, cruising through the twisting river, while being serenaded by the management that maintains the vicinity.<br/>
Reconnect with nature by visiting the Man-made forest in Bilar, a 2 kilometer forest abundant in Mahogany trees planted 50 years ago as part of the reforestation project of the province. About 30 minutes away from Bilar is the most popular tourist destination known nationwide, The Chocolate Hills. It has been the famous landmark of Bohol formed centuries as a result of tidal activities, during the summer season these grass covered little hills dries up and turns into dark brown peaks that make it look like bite size chocolates in a row.<br/>
