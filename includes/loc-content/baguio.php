The City of Baguio is regarded as one of the highly developed city in northern Luzon, now also known as the Summer Capital of the Philippines. The city was considered part of Benguet during the late 1900's but has since mandated to be independent from the province during 1917 and converted itself into an established city. The city later on has become the epicenter of innovation, business, and education being home to a population of 345, 366. Before it came the striving city that it is today, Baguio was first considered by the Americans in the early 1900's as a hill station in Kafagway in Ibaloi Village during Spanish-American War. It was the very first and only hill station used and built by the Americans in Asia. The name of the city originated from the Ibaloi word "bagiw" which means "moss". This is due to the city's altitude being 5,050 feet above sea level making it a great location to grow tropical pine trees and other mossy plants and almost every kind of flower.<br/>
